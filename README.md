# GrammarCorrectionTool
## Prologue
This repository contains a series of tests which focus on implementing varying techniques for effectively implementing a grammar polishing tool.



## Why Grammar Correction Matters

> In both professional and casual communication, clarity and correctness are vital.
> Organizations across domains—from education to corporate environments—require tools that help ensure written communication is grammatically accurate, contextually appropriate, and stylistically polished.

> Poor grammar can lead to misunderstandings, reduced credibility, and even reputational damage.

> While modern tools like grammar checkers exist, many are either limited in scope, require constant internet access, or are not easily extensible for custom use cases.

> This project attempts to bridge that gap through a lightweight, flexible grammar correction system that can operate in real-time and across documents, both online and offline.

## Motivation

> **On-the-fly correction**
> Real-time feedback helps users identify and fix grammar issues as they write, improving overall writing fluency and reducing the need for editing cycles.

> **Offline access and customization**
> Unlike commercial SaaS tools, this solution can run entirely locally and be tailored to specific workflows, domains, or linguistic styles.

> **Integration-ready design**
> Built with modularity in mind, it can be plugged into larger systems such as editors, document processors, or educational platforms.

> **Educational utility**
> The codebase serves as a useful starting point for developers, students, or researchers exploring natural language processing, grammar detection, or hybrid correction systems.
